### Palworld Base Optimizer
This is going to be an app that allows a user (from a GUI) to select 1-20 pals from palworld
and get a sum of their individual stats. 

Hopefully you won't have to scroll through base management to figure out which pals are using
space and which ones are worth it. 

Things that need to be added still
- gui lol
- a way to select pals from a list (dropdowns? idk?)
- sum individual stats & selected pals stats
- display everything in a NOT overwhelming as shit manner
